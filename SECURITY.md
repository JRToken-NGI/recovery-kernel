Security and Safety Reporting

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately to the maintainers. Do not post sensitive vulnerabilities in public issues.

For safety-sensitive content (clinical, genetic, or personal health data) follow these guidelines:
- Do not publish identifiable personal data.
- Use strong de-identification or synthetic/fictionalized examples for case studies.
- If you believe content could cause harm, open a confidential discussion with maintainers via email or a private channel listed in the repository contact details.

Maintainers will triage reports and respond with remediation steps. For immediate safety concerns involving people, contact local emergency services.
