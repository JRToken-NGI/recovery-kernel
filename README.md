# 🧑‍💻 **Recovery Kernel — JRToken‑NGI**  
### *Open‑source neurogenomics meets human‑first recovery engineering.*

Welcome to the **Recovery Kernel**, a fork‑friendly, globally accessible framework that reverse‑engineers addiction through systems thinking, neurogenomics, and unapologetically open knowledge. Built for hackers, researchers, clinicians, and anyone who believes human resilience should scale like good infrastructure.

This isn’t a self‑help book.  
This is a **protocol stack for understanding biological vulnerability** — translated into multiple languages, structured like a technical spec, and released under a license that says:  
**“Take it, break it, fork it, improve it.”**

---

## 🚀 **Why This Exists**
Because:
- biology shouldn’t be proprietary  
- recovery shouldn’t be paywalled  
- and public health deserves the same transparency as open‑source software  

The Recovery Kernel treats addiction not as a moral failure but as a **biological bottleneck** shaped by genetics, stress‑response pathways, and environmental load. No mysticism. No gatekeeping. Just structured knowledge.

## 🧬 **What’s Inside**
- **Multilingual editions** of the Recovery Kernel (20+ languages)  
- **Neurogenomic sovereignty whitepapers**  
- **Public‑health toolkits**  
- **Policy briefs** for governments and institutions  
- **Genomic literacy materials**  
- **A prototype kit** for mapping neurochemical pathways  

If it helps people understand themselves better, it’s in here.

## 🗂️ **Repository Structure**
```
/kernel_v1.0        → Canonical chapters + technical modules  
/localization       → All translated editions  
/framework_docs     → Whitepapers, handbooks, policy briefs  
/assets             → Images, diagrams, supporting files  
/legacy_distros     → Early drafts, fun experiments, archival curiosities  
```

## 🌐 **Who This Is For**
- engineers who like to optimize humans the way they optimize systems  
- clinicians who want clear, accessible science  
- policymakers who need structured, non‑ideological briefs  
- translators, educators, and open‑knowledge advocates  
- anyone who wants to understand why their brain does what it does  

If you’ve ever said “I rewrote the config because the defaults offended me,” you’ll feel at home here.

## Major Substance Classes & Groups

Opioids (primary focus; many CYP2D6/CYP3A4/OPRM1 correlations)
Depressants / CNS Depressants
Stimulants
Psychedelics / Classic Hallucinogens
Entactogens / Empathogens
New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)
Plant-based / Botanical substances
Polypharmacy combinations (analyzed for dangerous interactions)

Specific Substances Covered

Alcohol (ethanol) — GABRA2 variants, impulsivity correlation
Opioids (general class)
Heroin
Fentanyl
Codeine
Tramadol
Oxycodone
Hydrocodone
Morphine

Stimulants
Cocaine
Methamphetamine (meth)
Amphetamines (general)
Caffeine (CYP1A2 slow metabolizers)

MDMA (Ecstasy/Molly) — Serotonin depletion, "Suicide Tuesday" crash, interaction warnings (e.g., + Lithium)
Ketamine — In deadly combo warning (E+K=G=NEVER)
GHB (Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate) — In deadly combo warning
Cannabis (Marijuana) — CNR1/FAAH genes, paranoia/psychosis risk
Psilocybin (Magic mushrooms) — HTR2A correlations
LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) — Anxiety/psychosis risk
DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) — MAOA low activity, prolonged effects
Kratom — CYP2D6/3A4 inhibition, drug-drug interactions (DDIs), dependence potential
Kava — Hepatotoxicity risk, often combined (e.g., in products like Feel Free)
Benzodiazepines (general; implied in depressant stacking)
Barbiturates (historical/reference in polypharmacy cases)
Caffeine (as stimulant, CYP1A2 relevance)
Nicotine / Tobacco (implied in broader stimulant/depressant contexts)

Notable Combinations & Special Cases Analyzed

MDMA + Ketamine + GHB (fatal "E+K=G" warning)
Lithium + MDMA (serotonin syndrome + brain damage)
Polypharmacy in celebrity cases (e.g., Prince: fentanyl; Elvis: tolerance reset failure; Marilyn Monroe: likely CYP2D6/2C19 issues with multiple drugs)
