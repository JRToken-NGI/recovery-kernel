# 🧑‍💻 **Recovery Kernel — JRToken‑NGI**  
### *Open‑source neurogenomics meets human‑first recovery engineering.*

Welcome to the **Recovery Kernel**, a fork‑friendly, globally accessible framework that reverse‑engineers addiction through systems thinking, neurogenomics, and unapologetically open knowledge. Built for hackers, researchers, clinicians, and anyone who believes human resilience should scale like good infrastructure.

This isn’t a self‑help book.  
This is a **protocol stack for understanding biological vulnerability** — translated into multiple languages, structured like a technical spec, and released under a license that says:  
**“Take it, break it, fork it, improve it.”**

---

## 🚀 **Why This Exists**
Because:
- biology shouldn’t be proprietary  
- recovery shouldn’t be paywalled  
- and public health deserves the same transparency as open‑source software  

The Recovery Kernel treats addiction not as a moral failure but as a **biological bottleneck** shaped by genetics, stress‑response pathways, and environmental load. No mysticism. No gatekeeping. Just structured knowledge.

## 🧬 **What’s Inside**
- **Multilingual editions** of the Recovery Kernel (20+ languages)  
- **Neurogenomic sovereignty whitepapers**  
- **Public‑health toolkits**  
- **Policy briefs** for governments and institutions  
- **Genomic literacy materials**  
- **A prototype kit** for mapping neurochemical pathways  

If it helps people understand themselves better, it’s in here.

## 🗂️ **Repository Structure**
```
/kernel_v1.0        → Canonical chapters + technical modules  
/localization       → All translated editions  
/framework_docs     → Whitepapers, handbooks, policy briefs  
/assets             → Images, diagrams, supporting files

## 🌐 **Who This Is For**
- engineers who like to optimize humans the way they optimize systems  
- clinicians who want clear, accessible science  
- policymakers who need structured, non‑ideological briefs  
- translators, educators, and open‑knowledge advocates  
- anyone who wants to understand why their brain does what it does  

If you’ve ever said “I rewrote the config because the defaults offended me,” you’ll feel at home here.
