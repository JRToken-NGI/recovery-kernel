Recovery Kernel — Landing README

This repository is organized to separate the core kernel (kernel_v1.0), localized variants (localization/), framework whitepapers and assets (framework_docs/ and framework_docs/assets/), and legacy distro curiosities (legacy_distros/).

Structure
- kernel_v1.0/: Canonical kernel chapters and technical/module files (markdown).
- localization/: Localized book variants organized by region (APAC, EMEA, Americas).
- framework_docs/: Whitepapers, handbooks, and supporting reference documents.
- framework_docs/assets/: Images and archives used by framework documents.
- legacy_distros/: Historical or playful distributions retained for archival purposes.

If binary files appear as placeholders in framework_docs/ or localization/, please move the original files from the repository root into the intended folder and remove placeholders. For questions, see CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md.
