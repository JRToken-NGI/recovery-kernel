# 02 — Protocols (The recovery stacks)

Overview
- This chapter outlines conceptual "protocol stacks" used by communities to organize recovery-oriented interventions or support. These are frameworks for discussion, not prescriptive medical protocols.

Structure
- Each stack includes: Purpose → Inputs → Expected outputs → Safety checks → Escalation pathway.

Example stack (high level)
1. Assessment layer — collect context, risks, supports.
2. Stabilization layer — immediate-safety measures and harm reduction.
3. Therapeutic layer — evidence-based therapies and structured supports.
4. Maintenance layer — community supports, monitoring, and relapse prevention.
5. Escalation & clinical referral — when to involve professional care.

Safety & ethics
- Any actionable clinical decisions should involve qualified clinicians. Document decisions and consent. Prefer non-coercive, person-centered approaches.

Contributing protocols
- When proposing a protocol: include intended audience, evidence level, contraindications, and citation sources.
