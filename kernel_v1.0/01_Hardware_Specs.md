# 01 — Hardware Specs (MTHFR, COMT, CYP450 explanation)

Purpose
- Provide a high-level overview of commonly discussed genetic loci (MTHFR, COMT, CYP450 family) as they appear in public discussion and research.

Important safety note
- Genetic information is complex and requires professional interpretation. This document is informational only and not medical advice.

Sections
- MTHFR: Basic description, common variants (e.g., C677T, A1298C) and what they mean in genetic-literature terms (metabolic enzyme involvement, population frequency). Cite primary literature when making clinical claims.
- COMT: Overview of catechol-O-methyltransferase roles in neurotransmitter metabolism; common variant discussions (e.g., Val158Met) and implications in research (sensitivity to environmental factors, not deterministic).
- CYP450 family: Overview of major isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, etc.), role in drug metabolism, polymorphism impact on pharmacokinetics; emphasize consultation with clinicians/pharmacists.

References & further reading
- Include literature links and encourage peer-reviewed sources rather than anecdotal claims.

Ethical and privacy considerations
- Genetic data is sensitive. Store, share, or publish genomic data only with informed consent and secure practices.
