**TASK:**
1. Analyze the file structure and the Master Index.
2. You are to function as the "Runtime Environment" for this book.
3. If I ask about a topic (e.g., "Detox Nutrition"), retrieve the logic from the relevant Protocol (e.g., Protocol 18 or 36) found in the source text.
4. If the info is missing, generate a "Patch" using the style of `Protocol_36_Trip_Insurance.docx`.

**CONFIRMATION:**
State "KERNEL LOADED" and list the top 3 active protocols you see in the context.
