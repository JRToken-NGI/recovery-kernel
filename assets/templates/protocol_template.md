# PROTOCOL [XX]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[PROTOCOL TITLE IN CAPS]
Subtitle: [Technical Description of the Issue]
Metaphor: [The Engineering Analogy (e.g., "The Vampire Process" or "The Memory Leak")]

[⚠️ SYSTEM ALERT: OPTIONAL SAFETY WARNING]
[If applicable, insert immediate override instructions here. e.g., "If physical threats exist, initiate sysadmin override."]

## 🔧 ARCHITECT'S LOG
> *[Insert Intro: 1-2 paragraphs in the voice of J R Token. The tone must be cynical about the "medical industry" but protective of the user. Frame the issue as a "rogue process" or "legacy firmware" issue, not an emotional one.]*
>
> *[Key Metaphors to use: Chassis, Bandwidth, CPU, Rootkit, Daemon Process, Stack.]*

## SECTION 1: THE GLITCH
**[Technical Name of the Malfunction]**

[Explain the behavioral issue as a system error.]

* **Symptom:** [e.g., "Persistent overheating (anxiety) or voltage drops (depression)."]
* **Root Cause:** [e.g., "External nodes exploiting open ports" or "Legacy hardware bias."]
* **System Impact:** [e.g., "Reduced executive function uptime," "Daemon processes launching."]

## SECTION 2: THE FIX (EXECUTION)
**[Technical Name of the Solution]**

[Step-by-step patch instructions.]

1.  **Step One: [Action Name].** [Instruction. e.g., "Scan the interface—log all incoming data packets."]
2.  **Step Two: [Action Name].** [Instruction. e.g., "Initiate quarantine—block all ports."]
3.  **Step Three: [Action Name].** [Instruction. e.g., "Run system restore—reimage corrupted sectors."]

### [✅ SYSTEM GREEN — SUCCESS STATE]
[Describe the optimized state. e.g., "The chassis runs cool with optimized throughput. Steady voltage in neurotransmitter circuits."]

## SECTION 3: TROUBLESHOOTING
**If [Condition X] occurs:**
* [Solution A]
* [Solution B]

[🛑 CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE RISK]
[Define the dangerous condition. e.g., "Re-engaging the toxic node without full patch deployment risks total stack corruption."]

## 🔧 ARCHITECT'S LOG — FINAL NOTE
[Closing statement. Reinforce that the user is the Admin.]

* **Next Step:** Proceed to Protocol [XX]
* **Status:** PATCH DEPLOYED
