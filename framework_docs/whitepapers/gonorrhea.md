# Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infections: Genomics, Public Health, and Ethical Considerations in High-Risk Populations

## I. Introduction: The Complex Interplay of Genetics, Health, and Society in Gonorrhea Infections

### A. Acknowledging Public Health Imperatives
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) is a major bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) with substantial global burden, including an estimated 82 million new cases annually among adults aged 15–49. In men who have sex with men (MSM), prevalence remains elevated, with pooled global estimates around 7.2% (95% CI: 6.0–8.5) from 2000–2022 meta-analyses, often higher at extragenital sites (rectal and pharyngeal). Recent trends show declines in some regions (e.g., U.S. cases down ~10% in 2024 from 2023), but antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surges pose urgent threats: WHO data from 2022–2024 indicate ceftriaxone resistance rising from 0.8% to 5% and cefixime from 1.7% to 11%, with ciprofloxacin resistance at 95%. These intersect with neurogenomic vulnerabilities (e.g., MTHFR low activity and COMT Met/Met contributing to excitotoxicity, impulsivity, and reward-seeking loops that may amplify transmission risks in chemsex or high-partner contexts). Proactive screening, treatment, and AMR surveillance are essential to curb complications (disseminated infection, epididymitis, increased HIV risk) and prevent untreatable strains.

### B. Setting the Stage: The Multifaceted Nature of Gonorrhea Infections and Health Outcomes
Gonorrhea infections are multifactorial, driven by bacterial strain virulence, host immune response, behavioral exposures, and genetic predispositions. Extragenital sites (rectal, pharyngeal) predominate in MSM, often asymptomatic, enabling silent transmission. Urethral infections may cause discharge/pain, but rectal/pharyngeal are frequently silent. Complications include disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) and facilitation of HIV acquisition/transmission. Host genetics (e.g., HLA class II variants, TLR polymorphisms) influence susceptibility, persistence, and severity; environmental factors like minority stress and SUDs exacerbate risks. This report frames gonorrhea as a controllable biological exposure, with genomics offering risk stratification but behavioral/systemic interventions as primary controls.

### C. Ethical Framework and Sensitivity
Gonorrhea discussions in MSM and marginalized groups demand ethical rigor to prevent stigma, blame, or pathologization of sexual behaviors. Historical moral framing of STIs has fueled discrimination; this analysis uses precise, non-judgmental language focused on health equity and harm reduction. Recommendations emphasize voluntary, confidential screening/treatment, accessible services, and non-coercive approaches, respecting autonomy while addressing disparities without undermining personhood or societal roles.

## II. Overview of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Transmission, Prevention, and Treatment

### A. Transmission and Site-Specific Burden
Gonorrhea transmits via mucosal contact (urethral, rectal, pharyngeal, cervical). In MSM, extragenital infections are common: rectal (higher prevalence, often asymptomatic proctitis risk), pharyngeal (contributory to spread via oral sex), urethral (symptomatic discharge possible). Asymptomatic carriage drives most transmission.

### B. Prevention: Screening and Behavioral Strategies
No vaccine exists; prevention relies on multisite screening, treatment-as-prevention, and harm reduction. CDC recommends annual (or 3–6 monthly in high-risk) screening for MSM at all exposed sites (urethral, rectal, pharyngeal). Behavioral layers include consistent condoms (reduces risk), serosorting/status disclosure, partner notification, and reduced partners. DoxyPEP shows promise for bacterial STI reduction but requires AMR monitoring.

### C. Treatment: Curable but AMR-Challenged
Gonorrhea is treatable, but AMR limits options. CDC-recommended regimen (as of 2021, with ongoing monitoring):

- Preferred: Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM single dose (for uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, pharyngeal).  
- If chlamydia not excluded: Add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.  

Alternative regimens (e.g., gentamicin + azithromycin) for cephalosporin allergies or suspected resistance. Test-of-cure recommended for pharyngeal infections or treatment failure. Partner treatment essential to prevent reinfection. Rising ceftriaxone/cefixime resistance demands surveillance and potential future alternatives (e.g., investigational agents).

## III. Genetic and Pharmacogenomic Factors in Gonorrhea

### A. Genetic Susceptibility to Infection and Persistence
Host genetics modulate gonorrhea outcomes. HLA class II alleles (e.g., DRB1/DQB1 variants) associate with clearance vs. persistence/severity. Innate immunity genes (TLR1, TLR2, TIRAP polymorphisms) influence susceptibility, with ethnic disparities noted (e.g., higher risk alleles in some populations). Other factors include cytokine pathways and epithelial adhesion genes. User's MTHFR/COMT profile may indirectly increase vulnerability via chronic stress/excitotoxicity amplifying behavioral risks, though direct gonorrhea links are limited.

### B. Pharmacogenomic Considerations
Standard regimens (ceftriaxone/doxycycline) have minimal direct PGx impact, but user's CYP profiles (e.g., rapid CYP2B6) support standard dosing. MTHFR low activity suggests folate support for immune resilience during infection/stress. AMR in N. gonorrhoeae (e.g., gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance) is pathogen-driven, not host PGx.

## IV. Prevalence and Risks in Key Populations
MSM face elevated extragenital burden: pooled gonorrhea ~7.2% globally, higher rectal/pharyngeal rates in high-risk subgroups (e.g., HIV-positive, chemsex). Factors include multiple partners, condomless anal/oral sex, and co-infections. Neurogenomic siege (COMT/MTHFR) may compound via impulsivity loops.

## V. Prevention Strategies: Screening, Treatment-as-Prevention, and Public Health Approaches
Prioritize multisite NAAT screening for MSM (annual or more frequent). Combine with ceftriaxone-based treatment, partner services, and integrated PrEP/HIV care. AMR surveillance critical; no mandates—focus on stigma-free, accessible services to mitigate resistance spread.

## VI. Ethical and Societal Considerations
Screening must balance benefits (complication/HIV prevention) against harms (stigma, overtesting). In MSM, non-judgmental delivery builds trust. Equity requires addressing access barriers in marginalized groups to reduce disproportionate impacts amid rising AMR.
