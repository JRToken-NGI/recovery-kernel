# Monkeypox Virus Infection (Mpox): Genomics, Public Health, and Ethical Considerations in High-Risk Populations

## I. Introduction: The Complex Interplay of Genetics, Health, and Society in Mpox Infections

### A. Acknowledging Public Health Imperatives
Monkeypox virus (MPXV), now termed mpox, is an orthopoxvirus causing a zoonotic disease with human-to-human transmission via close contact, respiratory droplets, fomites, and sexual routes. The 2022–2023 global clade IIb outbreak disproportionately affected men who have sex with men (MSM), with >90% of cases in this group in many jurisdictions. In the U.S., Fort Myers/Florida saw localized clusters during the peak, with MSM accounting for the majority of diagnoses. Post-outbreak (2024–2026), cases have declined dramatically due to vaccination and behavior change, but sporadic transmission persists, and clade I strains in Central Africa remain more severe (higher mortality). Mpox intersects with neurogenomic vulnerabilities (e.g., user's MTHFR low activity causing supply-side methylation deficits and COMT Met/Met leading to demand-side catecholamine overload), potentially amplifying excitotoxicity, impulsivity, anxiety, and reward-seeking loops that drive high-risk sexual behaviors or chemsex patterns. Proactive vaccination, screening, and harm reduction remain essential to prevent resurgence, complications (secondary bacterial infection, proctitis, encephalitis in severe cases), and intersections with SUDs or mental health burdens.

### B. Setting the Stage: The Multifaceted Nature of Mpox Infections and Health Outcomes
Mpox is multifactorial, influenced by viral clade (IIb less severe than I), host immune status, genetic predispositions, and behavioral exposures. Transmission occurs via prolonged skin-to-skin contact (including sexual), respiratory droplets during close face-to-face interaction, or contaminated objects. Incubation is 5–21 days; rash (often anogenital/oral) follows prodrome (fever, lymphadenopathy). In immunocompetent hosts, illness is usually self-limited (2–4 weeks), but severe disease occurs in immunocompromised individuals (HIV with low CD4). Host genetics modulate severity: HLA class I/II alleles and innate immunity variants (e.g., TLR pathways, IFNL) influence viral control and inflammatory response. User's MTHFR/COMT profile may indirectly heighten vulnerability via chronic stress/excitotoxicity amplifying impulsivity or exposure behaviors, though direct mpox genetic links are limited. Outcomes are non-deterministic; vaccination and behavior change dramatically reduce risk.

### C. Ethical Framework and Sensitivity
Mpox discussions in MSM and other groups require ethical vigilance to avoid stigma, blame, or pathologization of sexual practices. The 2022 outbreak saw significant media framing that risked scapegoating; this report uses precise, non-judgmental language focused on health equity, harm reduction, and voluntary prevention. Recommendations prioritize accessible vaccination/screening, non-coercive education, and confidentiality, respecting autonomy, sexual identity, and personhood without implying moral failing or inevitability.

## II. Overview of Mpox: Transmission, Prevention, and Treatment

### A. Transmission and Disease Burden
Mpox transmits primarily via close, prolonged contact: sexual (skin-to-skin, mucosal), respiratory (droplets during prolonged face-to-face), or fomites (contaminated objects). In MSM, anogenital/oral lesions were common during the clade IIb outbreak, with sexual transmission driving spread. Asymptomatic or subclinical shedding occurs, though less frequent than symptomatic cases. Severe outcomes (proctitis, urethritis, encephalitis) are rare in immunocompetent hosts but higher in HIV+ individuals.

### B. Prevention: Vaccination and Behavioral Strategies
The JYNNEOS vaccine (non-replicating modified vaccinia Ankara) is highly effective:

- Two-dose series (28 days apart) → >80–85% effectiveness against mpox in real-world data.  
- Recommended for MSM with multiple partners, recent STI diagnosis, chemsex use, or living with HIV.  
- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) effective within 4 days of exposure (ideally 0–4 days).

Behavioral layers: condoms/barriers reduce (but do not eliminate) skin-to-skin risk, serosorting/status disclosure, reduced partners, and avoiding high-risk venues during outbreaks. Integrate with PrEP/HIV care for MSM.

### C. Treatment: Supportive and Antiviral Options
Most cases are self-limited (supportive care: pain management, hydration, wound care). For severe/protracted disease or immunocompromised hosts:

- Preferred: Tecovirimat (TPOXX) oral/IV (14 days).  
- Alternatives: Cidofovir, brincidofovir (limited use due to toxicity).

User's pharmacogenomic profile (normal CYPs mostly, ABCB1 A/A increased penetration) supports standard tecovirimat dosing but monitor for CNS exposure. MTHFR low activity suggests folate support for resilience during illness stress.

## III. Genetic and Pharmacogenomic Factors in Mpox

### A. Genetic Susceptibility to Infection and Severity
Host genetics influence orthopoxvirus outcomes. HLA class I/II alleles and innate immunity genes (TLR, IFNL, OAS) modulate antiviral response and severity. Rare variants in interferon pathways associate with severe disease in clade I contexts. No large GWAS yet for mpox specifically (due to outbreak recency), but parallels with smallpox/vaccinia suggest polygenic control of inflammation/clearance. User's MTHFR/COMT may indirectly increase risk via stress-exacerbated impulsivity/exposure, though direct associations are limited.

### B. Pharmacogenomic Considerations
Tecovirimat metabolism limited host PGx impact; user's normal CYPs support standard dosing. MTHFR low activity warrants folate/B-vitamin support to aid recovery from systemic inflammation/excitotoxicity.

## IV. Prevalence and Risks in Key Populations
2022–2023 global outbreak: >90,000 cases, predominantly MSM. Current U.S. cases low/sporadic (2025–2026), but resurgence risk persists. Factors include multiple partners, condomless sex, chemsex, HIV status, and venue attendance. User's neurogenomic siege (COMT/MTHFR) may compound via behavioral amplification.

## V. Prevention Strategies: Vaccination, Behavioral Interventions, and Public Health Approaches
Prioritize JYNNEOS vaccination for at-risk MSM (two doses). Combine with screening (lesion PCR during outbreaks), harm reduction (barriers, disclosure), and integrated PrEP/HIV care. No mandates—focus on stigma-free, accessible services to maintain low transmission.

## VI. Ethical and Societal Considerations
Vaccination campaigns must avoid stigmatizing MSM; emphasize equity in access and non-coercive uptake. Screening voluntary with counseling to reduce anxiety/stigma. Public health messaging should balance risk communication with destigmatization.
