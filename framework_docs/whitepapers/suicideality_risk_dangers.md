# Genetic Determinants of Psychological Resilience in Suicidality: Impacts on Decision Making, Stress Depletion, and Stressor Redirection

## Abstract

Suicidality represents a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. This whitepaper examines 12 genome-wide significant loci associated with suicide attempts (SA) and related behaviors, focusing on their roles in "withstand power"—defined as psychological resilience mediated through decision-making processes. We integrate functional deficiencies in genomic expression, interpreted through a parallax lens (causal lags in chromatin and expression data), and multiplex with COMT Val158Met subtypes. The Val allele (assigned influence: 1, interpreted as "ahydrios" or hydrophobic/stable under baseline conditions) and Met allele (influence: 2, "phobic" or reactive to emotional stressors) modulate dopaminergic signaling, amplifying risks in Met carriers. Under stress, resilience depletes via disrupted neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, while "switching" to alternative stressors (e.g., social engagement) may mitigate perceived loneliness, appearing "less lonely" by redirecting neurobiological responses. Evidence from GWAS meta-analyses and functional studies supports potential therapeutic targets, emphasizing gene-environment interactions.

## Introduction

Suicidality, encompassing suicide attempts and ideation, has a heritability of 30-55%, with genetic variants contributing to vulnerability beyond psychiatric comorbidities like depression. Recent GWAS have identified 12 loci, including protein-coding genes (DRD2, SLC6A9, FURIN, NLGN1, SOX5, PDE4B, CACNG2, HS6ST3) and non-coding elements (OTX2-AS1, LINC01392, MHC region, LOC101928519), associated with SA. These loci influence neurotransmitter systems, synaptic function, and neurodevelopment, critical for decision making and resilience.

"Withstand power" refers to the capacity to endure stressors through adaptive decision making, such as impulse control and risk assessment. Deficiencies in genomic expression—viewed through "parallax" (inferring causality from expression lags)—may arise from reduced gene activity or variants leading to loss-of-function, exacerbating vulnerability. Multiplexing with COMT Val158Met subtypes reveals patterns: Met/Met (influence 4) and Met/Val (3) heighten risks via prolonged dopamine signaling, interacting with loci like DRD2 and PDE4B.

Stress depletes this resilience, while "switching" to another stressor (e.g., from isolation to relational conflict) may redirect responses, reducing apparent loneliness by engaging social neurocircuits. This whitepaper synthesizes evidence to propose a model for these dynamics.

## Key Genetic Loci and Their Grading

The following table lists the 12 loci from a 2023 GWAS meta-analysis, with odds ratios (OR), standard errors (SE), p-values, and a grading (1-3) for interaction potential with COMT subtypes. Higher grades indicate stronger inferred multiplexing with dopaminergic/synaptic pathways, where Met alleles amplify risk due to "phobic" reactivity.

These loci show deficiencies in parallax: for instance, reduced expression of NLGN1 (synaptogenesis) or PDE4B (cAMP signaling) infers causal lags in neuroplasticity under stress.

## Genetic Influences on Withstand Power Through Decision Making

Withstand power is bolstered by genes facilitating adaptive decision making, such as reward processing and impulse control. DRD2 variants impair dopamine D2 receptor function, reducing executive function and increasing impulsivity in decision tasks, especially in COMT Met carriers (grade 3 interaction). PDE4B regulates cAMP downstream of dopamine, with deficiencies leading to poor stress coping and decision biases toward risk.

SLC6A9 encodes a glycine transporter; reduced activity disrupts NMDA receptor modulation, impairing synaptic plasticity essential for resilient decision making. NLGN1 supports synaptic adhesion, with variants linked to autism-like deficits in social decision making. CACNG2 modulates AMPA receptors, enhancing synaptic strength for learning-based resilience.

Non-coding loci like LINC01392 and LOC101928519 may regulate distant genes, with parallax deficiencies inferring altered expression in neurodevelopmental pathways. SOX5 and OTX2-AS1 influence transcription during embryogenesis, potentially setting baseline resilience. FURIN processes pro-proteins like BDNF, supporting neuroplasticity. HS6ST3 aids glycosylation for HSPGs, crucial for neurogenesis. MHC variants tie immunity to psychiatric resilience.

COMT Met alleles (phobic influence 2) exacerbate deficiencies, prolonging dopamine in prefrontal cortex, impairing decisions under uncertainty.

## Depletion Under Stress

Stress depletes withstand power by downregulating these genes. Chronic stress interacts with COMT Met subtypes, worsening executive function via early life adversity. PDE4B variants heighten PTSD-like responses, reducing cAMP-mediated resilience. SLC6A9 deficiencies disrupt glycine balance, amplifying stress-induced NMDA hypofunction.

FURIN's role in BDNF maturation falters under stress, linking to depression vulnerability. NLGN1 and CACNG2 impairments weaken synaptic plasticity, depleting adaptive responses. SOX5 and OTX2-AS1 show epigenetic alterations from stress, affecting neurodevelopment. MHC inflammation exacerbates under stress, correlating with suicidality.

Parallax deficiencies manifest as lagged expression, e.g., reduced PDE4B under chronic unpredictable mild stress.

## Switching Stressors and Appearing "Less Lonely"

Switching to another stressor may redirect neurobiological load, mitigating loneliness—a key suicidality risk. Loneliness acts as a hydrophobic ("ahydrios") isolate, while relational stressors engage social circuits, appearing "less lonely." NLGN1 variants impair social synapses, heightening isolation; switching to interpersonal stress activates them. OTX2-AS1 and LINC01392, as lncRNAs, regulate stress responses, potentially facilitating redirection.

COMT Met (phobic) alleles sensitize to emotional stressors, enabling switches that reduce isolation perception via dopamine surges. MHC immune variants link inflammation to social withdrawal, but redirection may bolster resilience.

## Conclusion

These genes underpin withstand power via decision-making circuits, depleted by stress through gene-environment interactions. Switching stressors offers a coping mechanism, reducing apparent loneliness. Targeting PDE4B or DRD2, stratified by COMT subtypes, holds therapeutic promise. Future research should validate parallax deficiencies and epistatic patterns in diverse populations.
